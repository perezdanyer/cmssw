# Validation

We use the Boost library (Program Options, Filesystem & Property Trees) to deal with the treatment of the config file.
Basic idea:
 - a generic config file is "projected" for each validation (*e.g.* the geometry is changed, together with the plotting style);
 - for each config file, a new condor config file is produced;
 - a DAGMAN file is also produced in order to submit the whole validation at once.

In principle, the `validateAlignments.py` command is enough to submit everything.
However, for local testing, one may want to make a dry run: all files will be produced, but the condor jobs will not be submitted;
then one can just test locally any step, or modify any parameter before simply submitting the DAGMAN.

## HOWTO use

The main script is `validateAlignments.py`. One can check the options with:
```
validateAlignments.py -h
usage: validateAlignments.py [-h] [-d] [-v] [-e] [-f]
                             [-j {espresso,microcentury,longlunch,workday,tomorrow,testmatch,nextweek}]
                             config

AllInOneTool for validation of the tracker alignment

positional arguments:
  config                Global AllInOneTool config (json/yaml format)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --dry             Set up everything, but don't run anything
  -v, --verbose         Enable standard output stream
  -e, --example         Print example of config in JSON format
  -f, --force           Force creation of enviroment, possible overwritten old configuration
  -j {espresso,microcentury,longlunch,workday,tomorrow,testmatch,nextweek}, --job-flavour {espresso,microcentury,longlunch,workday,tomorrow,testmatch,nextweek}
                        Job flavours for HTCondor at CERN, default is 'longlunch'
```

As input the AllInOneTool config in `yaml` or `json` file format has to be provided. One proper example can be find here: `Alignment/OfflineValidation/test/test.yaml`. To create the set up and submit everything to the HTCondor batch system, one can call

```
validateAlignments.py $CMSSW_BASE/src/Alignment/OfflineValidation/test/test.yaml 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster 5140155.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

To create the set up without submitting jobs to HTCondor one can use the dry run option:

```
validateAlignments.py $CMSSW_BASE/src/Alignment/OfflineValidation/test/test.yaml -d
Enviroment is set up. If you want to submit everything, call 'condor_submit_dag /afs/cern.ch/user/d/dbrunner/ToolDev/CMSSW_10_6_0/src/MyTest/DAG/dagFile'
```

## HOWTO implement

To implement a new/or porting an existing validation to the new frame work, two things needs to be provided: executables and a python file providing the information for each job.

#### Executables

In the new frame work standalone executables do the job of the validations. They are designed to run indenpendently from the set up of validateAlignments.py, the executables only need a configuration file with information needed for the validation/plotting. One can implement a C++ or a python executable. 

If a C++ executable is implemented, the source file of the executable needs to be placed in the` Alignment/OfflineValidation/bin` directory and the BuildFile.xml in this directory needs to be modified. For the readout of the configuration file, which is in JSON format, the property tree class from the boost library is used. See `bin/DMRmerge.cc as` an example of a proper C++ implementation.

If a python executable is implemented, the source file needs to be placed in the `Alignment/OfflineValidation/scripts` directory. In the first line of the python script a shebang like `#!/usr/bin/env python` must be written and the script itself must be changed to be executable. In the case of python the configuration file can be both in JSON/YAML, because in python both after read in are just python dictionaries. See `Example of Senne when he finished it` as an example of a proper python implementation.

For the special case of a cmsRun job, one needs to provide only the CMS python configuration. Because it is python again, both JSON/YAML for the configuration file are fine to use. Also for this case the execution via cmsRun is independent from the set up provided by validateAligments.py and only need the proper configuration file. See `python/TkAlAllInOneTool/DMR_cfg.py` as an example of a proper implementation.

#### Python file for configuration

For each validation several jobs can be executed, because there are several steps like nTupling, fitting, plotting or there is categorization like alignments, IOVs. The information will be encoded in a global config provided by the aligner, see `Alignment/OfflineValidation/test/test.yaml` as an example. To figure out from the global config which/how many jobs should be prepared, a python file needs to be implemented which reads the global config, extract the relevant information of the global config and yields smaller config designed to be read from the respective executable. As an example see `python/TkAlAllInOneTool/DMR.py`.

There is a logic which needed to be followed. Each job needs to be directionary with a structure like this:

```
job = {
       "name": Job name ##Needs to be unique!
       "dir": workingDirectory  ##Also needs to be unique!
       "exe": Name of executable/or cmsRun
       "cms-config": path to CMS config if exe = cmsRun, else leave this out
       "dependencies": [name of jobs this jobs needs to wait for] ##Empty list [] if no depedencies
       "config": Slimmed config from global config only with information needed for this job
}
```

The python file returns a list of jobs to the `validateAligments.py` which finally creates the directory structure/configuration files/DAG file. To let` validateAligments.py` know one validation implementation exist, import the respective python file and extend the if statements which starts at line 69. This is the only time one needs to touch `validateAligments.py`!

(list from mid-January)

## JetHT validation

### Validation analysis - JetHT_cfg.py

The vast majority of the time in the JetHT validation goes to running the actual validation analysis. This is done with cmsRun using the JetHT_cfg.py configuration file. To configure the analysis in the all-in-one framework, the following parameters can be set in the json/yaml configuration file:

```
All-in-one:

validations
    JetHT
        single
            myDataset
```

Variable | Default value | Explanation
-------- | ------------- | -----------
dataset | Single test file | A file list containing all analysis files.
alignments | None | An array of alignment sets for which the validation is run.
trackCollection     | "ALCARECOTkAlMinBias" | Track collection used for the analysis.
maxevents     | 1 | Maximum number of events before cmsRun terminates.
iovListFile  | "nothing" | File containing a list of IOVs one run boundary each line.
iovListList     | [0,500000] | If iovListFile is not defined, the IOV run boundaries are read from this array.
triggerFilter    | "nothing" | HLT trigger filter used to filter the events selected for the analysis.
printTriggers    | false | Print all available triggers to console. Set true only for local tests.
mc | false | Flag for Monte Carlo. Use true for MC and false for data.
profilePtBorders | [3,5,10,20,50,100] | List for pT borders used in wide pT bin profiles. Also the trend plots are calculated using these pT borders.
TrackerAlignmentRcdFile | "nothing" | Local database file from which the TrackerAlignmentRcd is read. Notice that usual method to set this is reading from the database for each alignment.
TrackerAlignmentErrorFile | "nothing" | Local database file from which the TrackerAlignmentExtendedErrorRcd is read. Notice that usual method to set this is reading from the database for each alignment.

### File merging - addHistograms.sh

The addHistograms.sh script is used to merge the root files for jetHT validation. Merging is fast and can easily be done locally in seconds, but the tool is fully integrated to the all-in-one configuration for automated processing.

The instructions for standalone usage are:

```
addHistograms.sh [doLocal] [inputFolderName] [outputFolderName] [baseName]
doLocal = True: Merge local files. False: Merge files on CERN EOS
inputFolderName = Name of the folder where the root files are
outputFolderName = Name of the folder to which the output is transferred
baseName = Name given for the output file without .root extension
```

In use with all-in-one configuration, the following parameters can be set in the json/yaml configuration file:

```
All-in-one:

validations
    JetHT
        merge
            myDataset
```

Any number of datasets can be defined.

Variable | Default value | Explanation
-------- | ------------- | -----------
singles    | None | An array of single job names that must be finished before plotting can be run.
alignments | None | An array of alignment names for which the files are merged within those alignments. Different alignments are kept separate.


### Plotting - jetHtPlotter

The tool is originally designed to be used standalone, since the plotting the histograms locally does not take more that tens of second at maximum. But the plotter works also together with the all-in-one configuration. The only difference for user is the structure of the configuration file, that changes a bit between standalone and all-in-one usage.

Below are listed all the variables that can be configured in the json file for the jetHtPlotter macro. If the value is not given in the configuration, the default value is used instead.

```
Standalone:              All-in-one:

jethtplot                alignments
    alignments               myAlignment
        myAlignment
```

Up to four different alignments can be added for plotting. If more than four alignments are added, only first four are plotted.

Variable | Default value | Explanation
-------- | ------------- | -----------
inputFile   |  None | File containing the jetHT validation histograms for myAlignment. All-in-one config automatically uses default file name for merge job. Must be given if using plotter standalone.
legendText  | "AlignmentN" | Name with which the alignment is referred to in the legend of the drawn figures. For all-in-one configuration, this variable is called "title" instead of "legendText".
color       | Varies | Marker color used with this alignment
style       | 20 | Marker style used with this alignment

```
